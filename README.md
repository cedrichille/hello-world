# Explore the History of Greenhouse Gas Emissions

## Access the app at: https://co2-history.herokuapp.com/

Based on the owid/co2-data repository, this project provides a helpful tool for analyzing and visualizing the data on CO2 emissions by country through history, with the aim of identifying correlations between economic development, population, industry activity, and climate impact. 


### What can you learn from the app?
Get a quick overview of different countries' greenhouse gas emissions in any given year. Or dig deeper into industry-specific emissions and other country characteristics. 

Understand how countries have contributed to climate change over time. Who contributed most in the 20th century? And who has taken the lead since the turn of the millennium?

Understand the contributions of groups of countries to climate change. What percent of global CO2 emissions are the richest 10% of countries responsible for? How has that shifted over time?

Learn how characteristics like GDP or population and emissions are related at different levels. Do the richest countries always contribute the most to climate change or is there a decoupling effect at some point?
